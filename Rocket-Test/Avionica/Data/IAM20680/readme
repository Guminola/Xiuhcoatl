/*
  The IAM-20680HT is a 6-axis MotionTracking device for
  Automotive non-safety applications that combines a 3-
  axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer in a thin
  3x3x0.75mm3 (16-pin LGA) package. It also features a
  4096-byte FIFO that can lower the traffic on the serial
  bus interface and reduce power consumption by allowing
  the system processor to burst read sensor data and then
  go into a low-power mode. IAM-20680HT, with its 6-axis
  integration, enables manufacturers to eliminate the
  costly and complex selection, qualification, and system
  level integration of discrete devices, guaranteeing
  optimal motion performance.
