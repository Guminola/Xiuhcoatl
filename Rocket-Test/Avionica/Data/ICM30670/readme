  The single‐chip ICM‐30670 is the world’s first dual interface Optical
  Image Stabilization (OIS) and 6‐axis motion tracking solution for User
  Interface, UI, with an integrated sensor‐hub and framework software.
  It combines industry leading gyroscope and accelerometer sensors
  with an ARM Cortex‐M0 CPU, and a DMP4 Digital Motion ProcessorTM
  in a small 4x4x0.98 mm LGA package.
  The ICM‐30670 provides a dedicated I2C Master interface for
  connecting to OIS controllers. Additionally, the DMP4 runs a gyro
  filter algorithm that allows for best in class OIS performance.
