/*
  The BMP280 consists of a Piezo-resistive pressure sensing element and a mixed-signal ASIC.
  The ASIC performs A/D conversions and provides the conversion results and sensor specific
  compensation data through a digital interface.
  BMP280 provides highest flexibility to the designer and can be adapted to the requirements
  regarding accuracy, measurement time and power consumption by selecting from a high
  number of possible combinations of the sensor settings.
  BMP280 can be operated in three power modes (see chapter 3.6):
  -sleep mode
  -normal mode
  -forced mode
